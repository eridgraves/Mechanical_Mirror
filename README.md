# Mechanical_Mirror
Driver code for a "Mechanical" mirror, as seen here: https://www.smoothware.com/danny/newshinyballsmirror.html


## Use
See requirements.txt for packages in environment.

## ToDo:
- Build the actual mechanical mirror. Current ideas include:
    - Blocks of wood at an angle, which rotate to show different shades.
    - Blinking lights, frequency of blinking determines shade.
    - Spinning black/white disks, angular velocity determines shade.
    - Ball bearings inside of holes, position determines shade.
- I plan to build one of each to demonstrate the control code and physical feasibility of each type. 
- A full mirror will require hundreds of individually controlled elements, which is difficult in production, maintenace, and control.
